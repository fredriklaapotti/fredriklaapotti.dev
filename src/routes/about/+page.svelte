    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        Father, husband, dog owner and avid reader, living in Sweden. A personal goal is to not define nor present myself based on profession, education or title.
        Computers and software are part interest and part work in my life, and has been an interest since my father made me a nerd with an Amiga 500.
        <br/><br/>
        This site is where I collect, organize and present various ideas and projects relevant to me. I hope to offer useful knowledge without even asking for a cookie in return. No, really: although the site is built with SvelteKit, I'm keeping it lean and simple. Think of it like an homage to the web of old.
        <br/><br/>
