I'm not really that old but oh how I fondly remember when the LAMP-stack was a thing. Yes, I'm aware it still exists and probably still run the majority of the web, thanks to WordPress. Having worked with WordPress for some years and not keeping up with the JavaScript frameworks made me realize how quickly we went from server side rendering, to single page applications, and apparently now the trend is to move back to rendering more on the server instead.
